# NurHomestay-Booking-System

This is a complete project that lasts for 3 semesters. 
Each semester, our team had been working on this project with NurHomestay Melaka as a part for our learning experiences. 
The first semester is to propose the system and documented the requirements into SRS document. 
After that, we designed the system and implement it. Lastly, we test our system functionality and documented the results.

To start off, read me first ;D
1. Check our system documentation at PILOT folder. I had put numbering file so that it should be easier to look at.
2. For this project, we used ECLIPSE (java language). As far as I know, it would be better if the project is import into the eclipse. I usually done this way.
 > Create a project in eclipse.
 > After that, you can download the files and directly insert the files into respective folder. It should have no problem except the database.
4. MySQL is used for this project. For the diagram, you can look at the SDD document. You may also need to edit at the connection file in the system to compatible with your localhost and database details.

I think that is all for the explanation. Thank you for visiting our site :)
